Collaborative game project from Game Programming Course Spring 2023
Original repository: https://github.com/dennis-lai96/Cellmon

This project utilized Twilio to play a Pokemon-style role playing game through SMS messaging.

This game is not able to be played anymore since the teacher owned the subscription to the Twilio service.
